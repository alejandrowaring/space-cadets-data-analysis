Looking at different sources of space related data available to answer the question How long before every day humans can go to space? What health requirements does one need to travel to space? Which country is leading the race to space based on space launches? 

- Start with historical information on space launches( who, when, why, manned or not)
- Pose the question of how long until the average joe can make it out into space at least once in their lifetime
- Look at the difficulties and costs related(medical, $/kg of past launches)
- Give a rough estimate of the decade we should be able to do it


Breakdown (tasks)
 
- Break down Historical information for all past space launches
- Who
- When ( We can label significant events here)
- Why
- Manned or unmanned
- Privatization
- Break down of cost/launch for manned launches
- Plot per location since some countries might be significantly cheaper
- Scatterplot of cost of launch vs time to predict reasonable price/person
- What is considered reasonable

Task breakdown 
- Cost related data = Nikunj 
- Countries launching when who = Alex 
- Public vs Private = Caitlin 
- RELIABILITY STATISTICS - Chipampe
